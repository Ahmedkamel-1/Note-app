# Note-app

Built the backend using Express and Mongoose, with JWT for authentication and bcryptjs for secure password
hashing. The backend supports user sign-up, login, and note CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations,
allowing users to register, authenticate, and manage their notes effectively. Environment variables are securely
handled via dotenv for configuration management
